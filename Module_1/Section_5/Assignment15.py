Create four string variables a, b, c, d to store the following values and display them:
• My city is Mexico
• Raghu is my friend's brother
• My favorite programming language is "Python"
• Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.
  It's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and it's syntax allows programmers to express
  concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as "C++" or "Java".
